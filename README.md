# Personal Website

This is my first personal website project, built using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Grid, and Sass. The website is designed to be responsive, visually appealing, and supports both **dark mode** and **light mode** for enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, adjusting smoothly for different screen sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- **Dark and Light Mode Support**: Users can switch between dark and light themes based on their preference or system settings.
- **Sass for Styling**: Styles are written using Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor that helps in writing cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Simple and Clean Layout**: Minimalistic design that focuses on content and user experience.
- **Vertical Dotted Line Between Texts**: The design includes vertical dotted lines between text lines for a unique look (a personal style choice).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **Flexbox**: For creating flexible and responsive layouts.
- **CSS Grid**: For advanced, grid-based layouts.
- **Sass**: For more modular and maintainable CSS.
- **css**: For theme switching between dark and light modes.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rafat-badawy/personal_website.git

   cd personal_website

   
This version highlights the dark and light mode feature, which is controlled either through user selection or by detecting the user's system preferences.
